## Setting up VSCode IDE

To get the max usefulness of the VSCode editor, we recommend installing [ZipFS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcanis.vscode-zipfs) for access to node module code and also to run the following commands: 

```sh
yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
code .
```

The second command will open the frontend directory as root into a new VSCode window. You should then see a pop-up to change the Typescript version to the workspace version generated by yarn. Select `Yes`. If this does not pop up, go to any `*.tsx` file and run `ctrl+shift+p` and type in `Typescript: Select Typescript Version...` and select `Use workspace version`. 

Note: If you get an error with `Missing package: prettier@npm:3.0.3` while trying to install, you may have to temporarily remove the package, run `yarn`, run `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode`, and then add prettier back and run `yarn` again.
